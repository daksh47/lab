if your function for example eomonth() is not found in program 5 search for it in other programs ( this case it is present in program 3 )

benched download the above excel sheet ( prgs.xlsx ) 
	- the table to the left of the blank space of column G is original dataset
	- the table to the left of the blank space of column G is operations performed according to each program
	- delete the rest parts expect your program

oprn prg6-9.ipynb and copy the program you want or download the prg6-9.ipynb and then in jupyter notebook navigate ( where you downloaded it ) and the open the file, and then delete the rest parts expect your program number

PROGRAM 1

- conditional formatting is applied to the row B , it highlights the age above 29
- if() is applied to the row H , which returns high salary if salary is greater than 55,000 else low salary
- countif() is applied to the row J , which returns the number of people from Bengaluru , after checking the row C
- sumif() is applied to the row K , which returns sum of salaries of people from Mumbai , it checks row C & D
- average() is applied to the row L , which returns average of salaries from the row D
- concatenate() is applied to the row I , which returns the concatenation ( adding string one after another ) of row A AND C


PROGRAM 2

- left() is applied to the row H, which returns a specified part of the string from the left or beginning of the string
	for example : left("hello",4) => hell
- mid() is applied to the row I, which returns a specified part of the string from a specified starting index, takes 3 parameter input
	for example : mid("hello",4,2) => lo
- right() is applied to the row J, which returns a specified part of the string from the right or end of the string
	for example : right("hello",3) => llo
- len()	is applied to the row K, which return a len of the cell
- substitute() is applied to the row L, it replaces a string with another, takes 3 parameter input
	for example : substitute("hello","ll","i") => heio
- search() is applied to the row M, which returns the index of a search element
	for example : search("llo","hello") => 3
- isnumber() is applied to the row N, which return true or false


PROGRAM 3

- today() is applied to the row H, which returns the current date,month and year
- now() is applied to the row I, which returns the current date along with time
- year() is applied to the row J, which returns the current year from a date
	for example : year("19-11-2024") => 2024
- month() is applied to the row K, which returns the current month from a date
- networkdays() is applied to the row L, which returns the number of working days between 2 dates ( Monday to friday )
	for example : networkdays("8-11-2024","8-1-2025") => 44
	this also accepts additional parameters for holidays
	ex: networkdays("8-11-2024","8-1-2025","25-12-2024") => 43
	to add multiple holidays use range a2:a6 
- eomonth() is applied to the row M, which returns the last day of the next number of months specified in serial format
	for example : eomonth("08-11-2024",1) => 31-12-2024
	,1 can also be 0 which returns the current month end date
	as it returns a serial number we have to convert it to date to do that , right click on the cell , then click format cells, then date , then ok


PROGRAM 4

- VLOOKUP() is applied to the row H, it looks for data vertically
	for example : vlookup("mohit",a2:b6,2,TRUE) => 28
	   |	  | 	   | 
        -
  	-  
	-
	- Mohit  28	"delhi"
	-

	in this "mohit" is searched vertically in the range a2:b6, when found it stores the complete row and the 2 specifies the 2nd element from the row 	that is 28
	
	- TRUE/FALSE is optional, true means apporx match ( default ), false means exact match

- HLOOKUP() is appleid to the row I, it looks for the data horizontally
	for example : hlookup("City",C1:D6,4) => C
	   |  |  |   	|
	-	City	sALARY
	-	A
	-	B
	-	C
	in this "City" is searched horizontally in the range c1:d6, when found it store the complete column and the 4 specifies the 4th element from the 	column that is "C"
	
	-true/false same as vlookup()

- XLOOKUP() is applied to the row J,it looks for a value in a range
	for example : xlookup("Mohit",a2:a6,d2:d6,"not found",1,1) => 55000
	in this "Mohit" is searched in the range a2:a6 and then the same index is used in d2:d6 to return the value
	"not found" is printed when no value is found
	1/0/-1 => 0 for exact match , -1 exact or smaller value , 1 exact or larger value ( works for both int and strings )
	1/-1 => last one is for searhcing from 1=> from beginning
					      -1=> from end

- COUNT() is applied to row K, return the number of numerical values present between a range
- COUNTA() is applied to row L, return the number of non-empty cells between a range


PROGRAM 5

- INDEX() is applied to row H, it returns a value from the specified index
		basically it converts the range to 1d or 2d array or table based upon the range specified and based upon the type of array index is 			specified
	for example : INDEX(a2:b6,3,4)
			this is 2d array or table and 3,4 refer to row and column respectively , meaning 3rd column 4th column

- MATCH() is applied to row I,it returns the index value from a range (ONLY 1D ARRAY OR ONE ROW/COLUMN TABLE)
- UNIQUE() is applied to row J,it returns all the element from a range that are unique or returns all different elements only once
- COUNTIFS() is applied to row K, it returns to a count of a value in a range
	for example : COUNTIFS(A2:A6,"MUMBAI")
			this returns the number of Mumbai in a2:a6
		    : countifs(a2:a6,"mumbai",d2:d6,">=50000")
			this returns the number of Mumbai in a2:a6 which index is used in d2:d6 and rechecks those index in this range where ">=50000" 				condition satisfies
			
		it can have any number of range:conditions value pairs
		ranges can be only 1d meaning a2:a6 only and not a2:b6
- SUMIFS() is applied to the row L, it returns the sum of range
	for example : SUMIFS(A2:A6,b2:b6,"mumbai")
		this returns the sum of a2:a6 , it adds only those index , where b2:b6 have "mumbai"
		this can have any number of range:conditions pairs like SUMIFS(A2:A6,b2:b6,"mumbai",h4:h1,"benchid")
		this should have at-least on range:condition pair
		ranges can be only 1d meaning a2:a6 only and not a2:b6

- AVEARAGEIFS() is applied to row M, exactly same as sumifs() , but instead returns the average
